What is it?
===========

On The Map is a Udacity iOS Nanodegree project focused on implementing networking fundamentals and closures in Swift.

On the Map allows users to log-in via Udacity or Facebook and then plot their locations on a world map.  Users can also view the locations of other Udacity students who have plotted themselves, as well as follow links those students have provided.

Implementation
==============

In order to implement On The Map, you will need to update the framework search paths for the Facebook SDK.

The Facebook SDK can be downloaded from Facebook here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios
